===================
= The 4th Dimension =
===================

Rules:
=======

The rules are the same for the for-in-a-row game, except the game is played out in 3 dimensions.
Place a marker
in a row
in a column
or in the diagonal in a square. Now turn that square 90 degrees and think of all the squares as layers in cube.

The "easy mode"/ "limited rule set" removes all but one 3d rule; the row/line that stay in the same x and y location and whose layer varies.


Credits:
========
The idea (and possible the name) comes from some old Mac game; this is a remake while staying true to the original
